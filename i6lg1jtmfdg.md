## Notes from writing

Kjellstrom and Corvalan \cite{kjellstrom1995framework} wrote about developing framework of environmental health indicators. Environmental health indicators are needed for providing a basis for decision making in health. The indicators must have both environmental data as well as health data, only one form of data is insufficient. The environment can be general environment, or it can be specific environment, and environmental hazards can be physical, biological, chemical but also social, economic, and technical. The two most widely used environmental health indicators are percentage of population that have access to drinking water and sewerage.
