## Notes from writing

Kjellstrom and Corvalan \cite{kjellstrom1995framework} wrote about developing framework of environmental health indicators. Environmental health indicators are needed for providing a basis for decision making in health. The indicators must have both environmental data as well as health data, only one form of data is insufficient. The environment can be general environment, or it can be specific environment, and environmental hazards can be physical, biological, chemical but also social, economic, and technical. The two most widely used environmental health indicators are percentage of population that have access to drinking water and sewerage. In 1980, WHO introduced the term environmental epidemiology. In 1992, the WHO initiated the health indicators for sustaibable development. Sustainable development is defined in terms of development that meets not only the needs of the present generation but also it should not compromise the development needs of future generations.  Not all SDI indicators fulfil these criteria as the ones that only depend on GDP miss that economic performance is not the sole aim of development; measures that reflect on environmental parameters miss that the component on sustainability; however, some SDIs such as the soil quality or soil stability over time are better indicators in this sense as they indicate the role of agriculture. Some indicators are static, i.e., they only point to the present state of affairs; others are dynamic that indicate change over time; dynamic indicators are better than static indicators. Similarly, analytical indicators, which incorporate elements of environment-health combinations, are better than descriptive indicators. A reliablie indicator is PAR (population attributable risk). Causal chain relates to the linkage between exposure and outcomes and antecedent causes. Whatever it is, EHIs mut include two elements: an environment-health effect linkage and some form of applicability to decision-making and action. It is difficult to have EHIs only on the basis of individual epidemiological studies, ecological or population based studies are needed
